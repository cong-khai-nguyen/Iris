# Description
The objective of this project is to determine whether the iris flower is Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolour or Iris Virginica based on the given data of the sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width of those flowers. Using linear SVM or support-vector machines model, I was able to predict correctly up to 100% of the testing data. Since this data set is quite small, I increase the test size to 30% and the decrease training size to 70%.
